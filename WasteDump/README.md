# Waste Dump and Recycling Folder


This directory constains lost and found files and workspaces i used back then, which can be password protected.
They are extremly disorganized and in their current state they are useless. 
However they still contain a lot of data which i've though lost.
They are here as a backup and will eventualy be organized and split across the actual repo.

(i haven't put anything here because the worspaces are 3GB in size because of the amount of duplicates)
